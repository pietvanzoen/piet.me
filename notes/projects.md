Here are a few of the projects I've built. Some are alright. ðŸ˜›

<!-- excerpt -->

### [Git get](https://github.com/pietvanzoen/git-get)

Keep your cloned repos nice and neat in a `go get` esk directory tree. Read more here: [How I organize my cloned git projects](/blog/organizing-git-projects/).

### [Hint](https://github.com/pietvanzoen/hint)

A command line tool to help you remember those little nuggets of knowledge.

### [Secrets](https://github.com/pietvanzoen/secrets)

CLI for setting and getting secrets using MacOS's keychain.

### [Dotfiles](https://github.com/pietvanzoen/dotfiles)

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them. But these are mine.

I live in the command line with zsh and vim. There's some good stuff here, some bad stuff, don't judge.
