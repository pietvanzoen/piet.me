A friend and I were sharing book recommendations and I found myself getting pretty excited about a short list of books. So I thought I’d share them here. To be fair, all I read is sci-fi right now. So I could just say “My favourite reads”. Oh well. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Also, I don’t feel good at describing books so I’ll keep my personal descriptions short. But please do follow the links and read the proper descriptions.

So, in no particular order…

## [The Murderbot Diaries - Martha Wells](https://app.thestorygraph.com/series/12)

A series of novella’s about an antisocial security cyborg that just wants to be left alone to binge watch sitcoms. Murderbot (as it likes to call itself) is an instantly lovable character.

Mystery, adventure, and sarcasm.

## [This is How You Lose the Time War - Max Gladstone, Amal El-Mohtar](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/598c1aad-4bda-437f-9e10-fcddd2152ae8)

A time traveling espionage love story. Need I say more? Well yes actually. The writing in this book is beautiful. There are points where I didn’t understand what was going on, but it didn’t matter, it was just beautiful.

## [Monk & Robot series - Becky Chambers](https://app.thestorygraph.com/series/5043)

I loved Becky Chamber’s Wayfarer series so quickly picked up her new Monk & Robot series. It’s beautiful and optimistic and challenged how I think about purpose and being.

Also now I just want to be a tea monk.

## [Project Hail Mary - Andy Weir](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ac3ea915-993d-4f30-8632-0f91e4ad0704)

I enjoyed The Martian, I was less excited about Artemis. But Project Hail Mary is such a fun and exciting read. Lots of fun science and a delightful side-kick.

# [Stories of Your Life - Ted Chiang](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c34ac03b-3b0e-4a24-b694-e46674918a3a)

The movie Arrival is based on the titular short story in this book. I enjoyed Arrival but it took a far more actiony blockbuster approach to the story. I remember coming away from reading this story feeling like my brain had been rewired. It was amazing.
