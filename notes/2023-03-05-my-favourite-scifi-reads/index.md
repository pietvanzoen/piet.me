A friend and I were sharing book recommendations and I found myself getting pretty excited about this list of books, so I thought I‚Äôd share them here. To be fair, all I read right now is sci-fi. So I could just say ‚ÄúMy favourite reads‚Äù. Ah well. ü§∑

Follow the links and read better descriptions than mine.

So, in no particular order‚Ä¶

## [The Murderbot Diaries - Martha Wells](https://app.thestorygraph.com/series/12)

A series of novella‚Äôs about an antisocial security cyborg that just wants to be left alone to binge watch tv. Murderbot (as it likes to call itself) is an instantly lovable and relatable introvert.

Mystery, adventure, and sarcasm. Oh my.

## [This is How You Lose the Time War - Max Gladstone, Amal El-Mohtar](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/598c1aad-4bda-437f-9e10-fcddd2152ae8)

A time traveling espionage love story. Need I say more? Well yes actually. The writing in this book is beautiful. There are points where I didn‚Äôt understand what was going on, but it didn‚Äôt matter, it was just... beautiful.

## [Monk & Robot series - Becky Chambers](https://app.thestorygraph.com/series/5043)

I loved Becky Chambers' Wayfarer series so I quickly picked up her new Monk & Robot series. It‚Äôs beautiful and optimistic and challenged how I think about purpose and being.

Also, now I just want to be a tea monk.

## [Project Hail Mary - Andy Weir](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ac3ea915-993d-4f30-8632-0f91e4ad0704)

Project Hail Mary is a super fun and exciting read and my favourite of Andy Weir's books so far. Lots of fun science, problem solving, and a delightful side-kick.

# [Stories of Your Life and Others- Ted Chiang](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c34ac03b-3b0e-4a24-b694-e46674918a3a)

The movie [Arrival (2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_\(film\)) is based on the titular short story in this book. I enjoyed Arrival but it took a far more actiony blockbuster approach to the story. I remember coming away from reading this story feeling like my brain had been rewired. I loved it, along with most of the stories in this book.
