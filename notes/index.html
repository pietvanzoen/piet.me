  <p>Delivering a working software product to end users is not a trivial task and there are a lot of things that can go wrong along the way. The end user experience of your product is not just made up of the code that your team writes. It’s also 3rd party software, deployment processes, configuration, servers, operating systems, databases,  networks, caching systems, and much more. Each of these components can and have gone wrong.</p>

  <p>On a surprisingly warm September Sunday morning I went to support my friend Martín doing a triathlon. I’m only just getting to the point where I can run a 5k, let alone a 750m swim, a 20km cycle <strong>plus</strong> a 5k. Martín and I went running together once. At the end of the 30 minute run he hadn't broken a sweat. Whereas I came home drenched. Suffice it to say, Martín is an athlete and I (currently) am not.</p>

We might be tempted to say "YOLO!" and move on. So here's a list of reasons why you might want to think twice before doing that.</p>

  <p>I recently switched from Jekyll to <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> for my personal website. After using Middleman for a couple projects I felt that Middleman was much easier to setup and manage than Jekyll, also I really don’t like liquid templating. The one thing I missed from Jekyll was automated deploys to Github pages. It wasn’t very difficult but you have to jump through a few hoops. Since I’m running my own build I decided to add some tests for my static site too. So here’s the how-to.</p>

  <p>Twelve months ago I had hardly written a single test. After some encouragement and guidance on how to write tests my world changed. Yes, there's lots of evidence that says writing tests reduces bug density (which is awesome), but that alone isn't necessarily going to persuade you to take the time to do them. What made me adopt a workflow where I write tests first? The fact that I enjoyed it!</p>

  <p>Often enough you'll need to reference sensitive credentials in your project, or give an easy way for people using your project to change environment relative information in your project. Normally it's not ideal to commit sensitive information to a public repository. Neither is it ideal to commit code which only works for your setup. Enter 'Environment Variables'.</p>

  <p>When my shared hosting plan was coming up for renewal I struggled to find a hosting service that I liked.
