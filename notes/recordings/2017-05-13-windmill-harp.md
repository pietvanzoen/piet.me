  Light harp plucking over ambient chords. Wind periodically muffles the recording. People quietly talk in the background.

On national windmill day we came across an art performance in a field by a windmill. It was a mix of ambient audio coming from speakers attached to the sails of the windmill accompanied by a harp and poetry recitals.

This is a short recording from that performance.
