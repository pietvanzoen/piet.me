  Part 1.

  Crowds chatter and cheer.

  The footsteps of runners move from left to right. A few moments after each runner passes a beep sounds to mark the completion of their run.

  People talk with each other in Dutch.

  The announcer is speaking over the PA system as athletes cross the finish line.

  Part 2.

  Crowds chatter.

  Patricia and I begin clapping.

  Patricia gives a long ‘yaaaaay’ and I cheer ‘Martin!’ as he passes by.

  A few moments later the beep sounds as he crosses the finish line.

On a surprisingly warm September Sunday morning I went to support my friend Martín doing a triathlon. I’m only just getting to the point where I can run a 5k, let alone a 750m swim, a 20km cycle **plus** a 5k. Martín and I went running together once. At the end of the 30 minute run he hadn't broken a sweat. Whereas I came home drenched. Suffice it to say, Martín is an athlete and I (currently) am not.

I captured some sounds from a spot about 10 meters before the finish line. The beep you can hear is the moment a runner crosses the finish line.

The first part is the best audio I caught of runners passing by. The second part is the moment Martín completed his triathlon. You can hear his wife and me cheering him on.
