I recently setup a [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net) for my home network. I‚Äôm using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with a PiJuice and a 3.5 inch PiTFT screen. Finding a case to fit all these was a little tricky. I don‚Äôt have a 3D printer (yet) and the tall cases I could find were a bit ugly.

I ended up using a PiBow case designed for PiTFT and made a couple modifications to get it to work with the PiJuice. I‚Äôm pretty happy with the result and wanted to share it.

## What I used

_Links are to where I purchased._

* Raspberry Pi 3b
* [PiJuice](https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/en/raspberry-pi/power-supplies/pijuice-hat-raspberry-pi-battery-module)
* [PiTFT 3.5‚Äù](https://www.elektor.nl/adafruit-pitft-plus-480x320-3-5-tft-touchscreen-for-rpi)

* [PiBow Lego base](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pibow-modification-layers?variant=1048948309) (optional)
* [3x PiBow expansion layers](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pibow-modification-layers?variant=1039417249)
* [Longer PiBow screws](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pibow-extender-bolt-pack)
* [Some M2.5 washers, standoffs, and screws](https://www.amazon.nl/gp/product/B07PDVXVZ5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

## The build

Before starting, be sure to remove the protective film from each of the layers of the PiBow. I put this all together with the film attached and had to redo the whole thing. ü§¶ Fortunately this gave me the opportunity to take photos of the process.

Here‚Äôs the mess of stuff I started with.

Mount the PiJuice on the raspberry pi with Layer 3 of the PiBow in-between. Use the nylon standoffs and screws that come with the PiJuice.

Turn the Pi over and use 5mm stand offs to secure the PiJuice to the Raspberry Pi.

On the PiBow layers you‚Äôll see numbers etched on the tops. Add layers 2, 1, and the base. I have the [Lego PiBow base](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pibow-modification-layers?variant=1048948309) but the regular base will work too. Be careful to put the Lego base the right way up or it won‚Äôt work.

Secure the base using the extended PiBow bolts in the corners *and* use M2.5 screws going into the standoffs to secure the Raspberry Pi and PiJuice.

Rather than using layers 4, 5, 6, and 7 that come with the PiBow kit, we‚Äôll use 4 nylon washers on each corner bolt. Because of the buttons and power socket on the PiJuice I couldn‚Äôt use the standard PiBow layers that normally surround the Raspberry Pi HDMI and power ports.

Now add layer 7 and three clear expansion layers. These layers will surround the PiTFT.

For the PiTFT to fit on top of the PiJuice I had to carefully clip the 26 pins on the back of the screen.

Finally I used layer 9 and secured it all using the nylon bolts.

## Done!

That‚Äôs it! Pretty good looking if I say so myself. :) Especially running with no cables and [PADD](https://github.com/pi-hole/PADD) on the display.

Here‚Äôs the PiHole running. To mount the Pi I attached a flat piece of Lego to the wall in my utility closet using some removable adhesive strips.

I may find some slightly longer bolts in the future because I‚Äôd like to add the last clear layer included in the PiBow kit. The extended bolts weren‚Äôt quite long enough.
