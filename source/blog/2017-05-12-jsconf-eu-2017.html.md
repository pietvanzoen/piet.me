Our front end team at Usabilla had the amazing opportunity to attend JSConf EU in Berlin this year. It was a fantastic experience for us all and we came home having learned a ton. This is just a summary of my key take-aways from the conference.

## Your site can (and should) be accessible

Whenever we think about accessibility on the web we tend to just think of providing access to people with disabilities. [Laura Carvajal](https://twitter.com/lc512k) from FT.com suggests we reframe this idea:

> "Beyond **not denying** access, it's ensuring that access is **fair** for everyone."

There are a plethora of ways that people end up having trouble using the web, be it temporary or permanent. Our job is to build the web in a way that enables access for all our users, and not just those that engage with the web the same way we do.

15% of the global population have some form of disability. After research FT.com found that 26% of their users had some form of disability. Considering that we go to great lengths to support users on a wide range of browsers, some of which have <5% usership, it's only consistent that we support the tools that at least a sixth our users use.

So how do we work towards ensuring fair access for all our users? Here are some suggestions Laura offered:

### Install pa11y

[pa11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pa11y) is a great way to ensure your site is [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) compliant. Make pa11y a part of your build process and have your build fail when there are issues.

### Get an Accessibility Audit

Ensuring WCAG compliance only covers about 35% of accessibility issues. Accessibility audits provided by organisations like [Digital Accessibility Centre](http://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/) put your app/site in front of people who face various accessibility issues. Laura showed an enlightening video from people testing FT.com, which highlighted the diverse range of issues people face with modern websites. There's no way you can anticipate all these issues, so putting your site in front of real people is a great way to gain insight.

### Ditch the Mouse

Many internet users only use a keyboard to interact with the web. To really understand what these users experience, Laura and her team got rid of their mice and went keyboard only. Check out [Laura's talk slides](https://speakerdeck.com/lc512k/jsconfeu-2017-yes-your-site-can-and-should-be-accessible) for tons of tips for going keyboard only.

## Getting out of our performance bubble

I'm gonna go ahead and say that [Ben Schwarz](https://twitter.com/benschwarz) from [Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/) has coined the phrase "Wealthy Western Web" to describe the web that most of us develop in. We work on â‚¬2000+ computers on 100+ Mbit/s fiber. Even on mobile we're often working with high-end devices on 20 Mbit/s LTE connections. The World Wide Web is a very different place. The average device is about 5x slower than our laptops and 60% of the world is on 2g mobile data connections.

There are a number of ways to start testing the performance of our apps against devices that most people use. Calibre's platform and Google Lighthouse provide people-centric metrics for web app performance. Specifically **Time to First Interaction** is a much better metric for app performance than something like page load time because it considers the time it takes for the device to parse the application and render it to a point that it's usable. A 410kb gzipped bundle is nice and small to download but once uncompressed the device has to handle 3-4 megabytes of code.

There were lots of talks about performance optimisation at JSConf. But without metrics to judge against you have no idea how effective your optimisations are and if you're optimising the right thing. I'm really looking forward to giving Calibre a shot after chatting with Ben.

## A new bar for conferences

JSConfEU was the best conference I have ever attended. First off, it achieved everything you would want from any conference. Amazing speakers, amazing topics, amazing community, amazing execution. The venue was beautiful, the day to day flow of things was almost flawless, the food was fantastic and they managed to serve 900+ people within 20 minutes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

But wait there's more.

The speakers were 50/50 men/women. Not all white. All food was vegetarian friendly, vegan friendly, and high quality. (I'm neither vegetarian or vegan but loved the food.) They provided childcare, gender neutral restrooms, gender identity badges, scholarships, and drinks in glass bottles over plastic.

JSConfEU was an excellent example of what a conference should look like. Diverse, inclusive, and shamelessly advocating for those things.

## Final Words

Building tools and events that are accessible to all people is achievable **if you prioritise it**. And you should because it's just the right thing to do, and if you need another reason, you should because it benefits everyone.

Making code performant for the average device improves performance on all devices. Making apps work for all platforms (browsers, screen readers, keyboards) results in a better user experience for all. Continuously striving to provide spaces (physical or digital) accessible to all people make your communities more cohesive and wiser.

The talks and the conference itself were an eye opening example of what events and the web could and should be, and it's an awesome picture. There are lots of hard problems to solve, but that's what we as developers signed up for, to solve hard problems. So let's do it.

## Final Final Wordsâ€¦ Thank you

First, thanks to all the organisers and speakers at JSConf for putting on a terrific and inspiring event.

I also want to thank [Usabilla](https://usabilla.com/) for giving us the opportunity to attend. The company paid for our flights, accommodation, and the conference fees. I'm well aware that without a company that prioritises all the points above I probably would not have been able to attend.

Last, thanks to all my team mates for making the weekend in Berlin a blast. ðŸ˜¬
