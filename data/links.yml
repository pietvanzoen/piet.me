  description: The (Switch)-Case for State Machines in User Interfaces ◆ 24 ways
  extended: |-
    Describing all the possible user flows and business logic of an application can become tricky. Ironically, user stories might not tell the whole story – they often leave out potential edge-cases or small yet important bits of information.

    However, one important (and very old) mathematical model of computation can be used for describing the behavior and all possible states of a user interface: the finite state machine.

    dedicated to the subject. But many of them propogated misunderstandings of Kent's
    original rules so that TDD practice bears little resemblance to Kent's original
    ideas. Key misunderstandings around what do I test, what is a unit test, and what
    is the 'public interface' have led to test suites that are brittle, hard to read,
    and do not support easy refactoring. In this talk we re-discover Kent's original
    proposition, discover where key misunderstandings occured and look at a better
    approach to TDD that supports sofware development instead of impeding it. Be prepared
    from some sacred cows to be slaughtered and fewer but better tests to be written,\n\n"

    I wanted to talk to you about a problem in our community that we need to address.
