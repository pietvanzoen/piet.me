  <h1 class="text-center">Hi, I&#39;m Piet.</h1>
  <p class="home-intro"><span>I build things for the web.<br>This is my website.</span></p>

  <p>Last year I wrote about <a href="/blog/rethinking-my-piece-of-the-internet/">reclaiming this little piece of the internet</a> for myself again. So when I learned about <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden">digital gardens</a> I was immediately intrigued. I&#8217;ve often struggled hitting the publish button, so the idea of a space that&#8217;s meant to be personal and a work in progress resonated with me. </p>

  <p>So here it is. The next evolution of my little plot of the internet. </p>

  <p>This is where I capture notes and thoughts on the things I&#8217;m interested in. This includes web development, all things command line, vim, cats, family, expat life, field recording, 3d printing, and general tinkering. </p>

  <p>Below are some of my favourite posts. Thanks for visiting. üôè</p>
