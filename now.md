Here's a quick run down on what's going on with me. 

## General

**Where:** Leiden, Netherlands

**Work:** Building a wood manufacturing marketplace at Cutr.com.

**Gifable:** I'm not usually one for a side project. But right now I have one! Having fun building [Gifable](https://www.gifable.club), a self-hostable gif/meme library manager. Building it with [Remix](https://remix.run).
